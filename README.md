## Features & Usage

|  Feature                  | Description |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **Custom Model Support** | Define any PyTorch model (MLP, CNN, Transformer, etc.) and visualize it directly. |
| **Interactive Play Mode** | Animate activations flowing through the network with a single click. |
| **Layer & Neuron Mapping** | Shows layers, neurons, and weighted connections clearly. |
| **Load `.pth` Files** | Import and visualize pretrained models saved in PyTorch. |
| **Deploy Anywhere** | Works locally or on GitHub Pages for free hosting. |

- Provide `Python Model` code + load `.pth` model file.
- Displays layers, neurons, and weighted connections by use `Build` button
- Interactive `Run` button to animate activations

## Getting Started (Run Your Own Locally)

### 1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Iro96/NeuralNet-Visualizer.git
cd neural-net-visualizer
```

### 2. Start the backend server

```sh
python server.py
```

### 3. Experience the tool
